better readme coming sooooon!


Main C code for Twitchie.Comments need lots of work.

The most important file is "tiny_twitchie.c". The rest is just for people that want to use AVR Studio and WinAVR.

If you use any other setup to compile your code, you might want to write your own make file. Best of luck!

instructions.pdf is for the end user and includes electronic assembly instructions.

3D_files include Blender files made with a Makerbot orother 3-D printer in mind.

PCB_files are EAGLE files, with .png preview files. Use these to make the circuit boards.
